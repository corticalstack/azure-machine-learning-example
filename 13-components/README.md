# Azure Machine Learning Components

## Introduction

An Azure Machine Learning component is a self-contained piece of code that performs one specific step in a machine learning pipeline. Similar to a function in programming, a component has a name, inputs, outputs, and a body. Components serve as the fundamental building blocks of Azure Machine Learning pipelines, enabling modular, reusable, and maintainable machine learning workflows.

## What is a Component?

A component consists of three essential parts:

1. **Metadata**: Includes name, display_name, version, type, and other identifying information.
2. **Interface**: Defines input/output specifications (name, type, description, default value, etc.).
3. **Command, Code & Environment**: Specifies the command to execute, the code to run, and the environment required for execution.

## Why Use Components?

Components offer several advantages for machine learning pipeline development:

- **Well-defined interface**: Components require clear input and output definitions, making it easier to build and connect pipeline steps while hiding implementation complexity.
- **Share and reuse**: Components can be easily shared across pipelines, workspaces, and subscriptions, enabling collaboration between teams.
- **Version control**: Components are versioned, allowing producers to improve components while consumers can use specific versions for compatibility and reproducibility.
- **Unit testable**: As self-contained code units, components are easy to test independently.
